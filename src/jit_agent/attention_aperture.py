"""System-owned default memory exposure for every percept.

The attention aperture is deliberately not a capability and does not depend on
an LLM deciding whether unseen memory might matter. Every interaction receives
one bounded, provenance-bearing activation packet derived from the current
percept plus durable WorkingState. Valid active WorkingState is guaranteed
exposure; the aperture recall budget limits only additional baseline history.
When the v2 Composer finds the packet insufficient, deterministic Adaptive
Recall may widen or deepen retrieval. Basic memory availability and every
retrieval-stage choice remain part of Prometheist's cognitive substrate.

The aperture uses JIT Memory's activation boundary rather than its stricter
evidence-admission boundary. An aperture item means "potentially relevant enough
to keep available now," not "proved sufficient support for a claim."
