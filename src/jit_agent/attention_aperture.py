"""System-owned default memory exposure for every percept.

The attention aperture is deliberately not a capability and does not depend on
an LLM deciding whether unseen memory might matter. Every interaction receives
one bounded, provenance-bearing activation packet derived from the current
percept plus durable WorkingState. Valid active WorkingState is guaranteed
exposure; the aperture recall budget limits only additional baseline history.
A later model decision may request ``deeper_research`` when the initially
supplied context is insufficient, but basic memory availability is part of
Prometheist's cognitive substrate.

The aperture uses JIT Memory's activation boundary rather than its stricter
evidence-admission boundary. An aperture item means "potentially relevant enough
to keep available now," not "proved sufficient support for a claim."
