"""Incremental freshness helpers for disposable memory projections.

Steady-state recall must not establish freshness by materializing the lifetime
canonical ledger. A pair of per-event projections acts as the committed
high-water mark: lexical evidence and association features are written in the
same transaction as any new association edges. If their high-water marks ever
disagree, callers must rebuild disposable state rather than guess across a gap.
