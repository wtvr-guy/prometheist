"""Minimal durable active-situation state for stateless interaction continuity.

Working state is deliberately simple: it records which canonical events are
currently active. It does not parse natural language into an ever-growing set
of phrase-specific referents, labels, entities, or conclusions. Fresh workers
rehydrate those canonical events through JIT Memory, and semantic interpretation
remains a stateless inference concern rather than hard-coded application logic.
