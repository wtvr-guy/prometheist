# Lossless Progressive Memory and Bounded Recall

**Status:** authoritative architectural decision beginning 2026-08-26.

This document freezes the memory-scaling constraints that future Prometheist milestones must preserve. It supplements `COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MEMORY_KERNEL.md`, and `ASSOCIATIVE_MEMORY.md` and supersedes any older wording that would permit an already-admitted durable memory to be replaced by a summary, abstraction, embedding, aggregation, or other lossy derivative.

## Core rule

> **Prometheist keeps durable memory lossless. It may reduce the active working set, but it may not reduce a persisted memory into a substitute representation.**

Storage is treated as comparatively abundant. The scarce resources are attention, active RAM, CPU/GPU/VRAM, inference time, I/O bandwidth, and model context. Prometheist therefore optimizes the movement and computation performed over memory rather than the existence of memory itself.

## Durable-memory admission boundary

External input may be ephemeral before a retention decision admits it into durable memory.

```text
external input
      |
      v
ephemeral observation
      |
retention/admission decision
   /                \
not admitted         admitted
                         |
                         v
                canonical durable memory
```

Before admission, deterministic retention policy may discard data that never became durable memory. After admission, ordinary retention, compaction, indexing, or storage-pressure policy must not replace or delete the canonical memory. Explicit user-directed erasure, if later supported, is a separate governance operation and must never be confused with automatic compression or retention policy.

## Source authority

Canonical durable memories are authoritative evidence.

A durable memory must preserve its exact admitted content and provenance. Its logical identity must remain stable when the bytes move between storage devices or backends.

Derived structures may include:

- full-text indexes;
- vector embeddings used only as retrieval coordinates;
- entity mentions and identifiers;
- association edges;
- temporal or causal links;
- coreference candidates;
- situation/topic membership;
- salience and activation metadata;
- access statistics;
- storage manifests and availability metadata.

These structures are routing and navigation aids. They are not memories and may never substitute for the exact source evidence they reference.

The long-lived invariant remains:

```text
association/index -> candidate activation -> canonical source memory -> evidence
```

## No memory summaries

Prometheist must not create or persist summaries of durable memories as memory substitutes, retrieval substitutes, or supposedly equivalent compressed representations.

A later model invocation must not be asked to trust a prose condensation of earlier evidence when the factual answer depends on that evidence. Factual recall must ultimately dereference exact source memories.

This prohibition includes generational summarization in which one model summarizes source memories and later models reason from the summary instead of the source. Such a pipeline would introduce cumulative lossy distortion and violate the accuracy objective.

## Derived structures are disposable

Indexes and annotations should be rebuildable from canonical source memory wherever their derivation permits it.

If embeddings are deleted, they can be recomputed. If an entity linker improves, its mappings can be rebuilt. If a coreference model proves unreliable, its edges can be discarded and regenerated.

Destroying a derived index is an operational inconvenience. Destroying the only canonical source memory is actual memory loss.

Derived assertions that are not deterministically reconstructable must carry explicit provenance, derivation method/version, and non-authoritative status. They may guide retrieval, but supported factual recall must still dereference the source evidence.

## Progressive associative recall

Prometheist must not interpret a memory request as a request to retrieve everything associated with a subject.

Ordinary recall is progressive:

1. activate the strongest present cues;
2. navigate a bounded associative neighborhood using inexpensive deterministic/indexed operations where possible;
3. rank candidate memory identifiers;
4. dereference a small exact evidence set;
5. invoke an LLM only when semantic interpretation or reasoning actually requires it;
6. expand another bounded layer only when the current evidence is insufficient for the requested recall depth.

A cue such as a person's name should normally activate a small set of distinctive and currently relevant exact memories rather than every recorded interaction involving that person. A request for greater detail may progressively widen the search. Exhaustive historical analysis is a different workload and is allowed to consume substantially more total compute.

## Activation, salience, and storage temperature are distinct

Prometheist must not collapse these into one score.

**Salience** describes how significant or distinctive an observation or memory is under the current policy/history.

**Activation** describes how relevant a memory, entity, association, task, or situation appears to the present cognitive state.

**Storage temperature** describes physical retrieval cost and availability, not meaning.

A decades-old memory may have high salience, low current activation, and cold physical storage. A new cue may sharply raise activation without altering the source memory. Repeated use may then promote exact bytes into a faster cache without changing logical identity or content.

## Semantic identity is independent of storage location

Prometheist must not make a physical volume semantically own a person, topic, or situation. One memory may participate in many associations.

Each durable memory should eventually have:

- a stable logical memory/event identifier;
- a cryptographic content hash or equivalent integrity identity;
- exact provenance;
- one or more physical storage locations;
- availability/integrity state for each replica.

A storage manifest may map the same canonical memory to internal NVMe, external SSD/HDD, removable media, NAS, cloud, or future archival backends. If a replica is unavailable, Prometheist may know that the memory exists and where it lives, but must not pretend to have inspected unavailable source evidence.

## Bounded LLM context is a hard invariant

No ordinary memory mechanism may solve scale by increasing one model invocation's context in proportion to corpus size.

Every LLM invocation must eventually have a policy-bounded maximum working context. This applies to the whole invocation, not only a `MemoryPacket`. A worker may not defeat stateless-model architecture by accumulating an ever-growing hidden research transcript and replaying it into later calls.

A worker that needs additional history must externalize compact structured task state and request exact evidence as needed rather than drag an unbounded transcript forward.

## Bounded ordinary compute is also a goal

Flattening context while exploding the number of model calls is not an acceptable ordinary-case solution.

For routine recall, total LLM calls and active compute should remain small as the durable corpus grows. Most navigation should rely on conventional deterministic/indexed operations such as exact identifiers, SQL, full-text search, temporal filtering, sparse association traversal, entity intersections, and other cheap routing mechanisms.

Large forensic questions may legitimately create large durable workloads, but their work must be partitioned into bounded operations with exact provenance. They are exceptional analyses, not the normal recall path.

## Evidence navigation

JIT Memory should mature from a top-k retrieval service into an evidence-navigation capability.

Its target question is:

> **What is the smallest exact source-evidence set that satisfies the present information need, and which bounded association path should be explored next if that evidence is insufficient?**

The capability may use derived indexes to identify candidate evidence, but the packet consumed by factual reasoning must remain grounded in canonical source memories.

## Scaling hypothesis

Prometheist's central memory-scaling hypothesis is:

> **Recall quality can remain accurate over an increasingly large lossless corpus without proportional growth in any individual LLM context window or in ordinary-case LLM inference count.**

Future memory benchmarks must therefore measure at least:

- exact source-evidence recall;
- provenance correctness;
- false-memory/unsupported-claim rate;
- maximum tokens in any LLM invocation;
- maximum memory tokens in any invocation;
- total LLM calls per recall task;
- candidate memories examined;
- association-hop depth;
- database/index operations;
- CPU time and peak RAM;
- latency;
- index/storage growth;
- archive reads and cache promotions.

Corpus-size experiments must freeze the query families while increasing corpus scale so that both the context-bloat curve and the ordinary-compute curve are visible.

## Milestone implications

### v0.7

The Attention Fabric remains the immediate implementation priority. It provides the resource-governed execution substrate needed to keep future retrieval and reasoning bounded.

### v0.8

Perception/salience must distinguish attention-worthiness from durable-memory admission. Salience may influence what receives further processing without itself rewriting memory.

### v0.9

Retention must implement an explicit durable-admission boundary. Any earlier language such as `raw-to-derived aggregation` is valid only for pre-admission/ephemeral processing or for creation of disposable indexes alongside canonical source data. It must never mean replacing an admitted durable memory with a derived representation.

### v0.10

Memory generalization must explicitly test progressive associative recall, activation, exact evidence dereferencing, long-horizon coreference/relationship navigation, and context/compute scaling across larger corpora.

### v1.0

A defensible v1.0 must demonstrate lossless source-backed durable memory and bounded provenance-bearing recall whose ordinary per-invocation context and inference cost do not grow proportionally with corpus size.
