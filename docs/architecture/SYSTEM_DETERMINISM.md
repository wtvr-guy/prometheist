# System Determinism

**Status:** constitutional architecture deep dive.  
**Constitutional authority:** implements Articles 9 and 10 of [`../../CONSTITUTION.md`](../../CONSTITUTION.md).

Prometheist uses probabilistic models as disposable semantic compute inside a deterministic application envelope. The system does not require every physical execution detail to be deterministic; it requires every durable control-plane decision that can be made deterministically to be owned, recorded, and replayable by ordinary software.

## Core invariant

> **Given the same authoritative durable state, the same authoritative external/resource observations, and the same policy versions, Prometheist must reconstruct the same durable system decision.**

This is the determinism boundary.

The operating system may schedule threads differently. A local model may sample different language if sampling is enabled. Network timing may vary. Those facts do not authorize a race, hidden model preference, or process-local state to decide which durable task owns attention, which resource reservation wins, which capability is legal, which event is authoritative, or which side effect is allowed.

## What ordinary software owns

Where the decision can be represented mechanically, application policy owns it. This includes at least:

- stable/deterministic identifiers where inputs permit them;
- authoritative event/task sequence numbers and total-order tie breakers;
- priority derivation and service-guarantee promotion;
- dependency graphs and dependency closure;
- capability IDs, availability, permissions, dependencies, and execution ordering;
- scheduling epochs, assignments, reservations, and preemption selection;
- resource-safety formulas and policy versions;
- retention/admission/deletion authority;
- retry, idempotency, lease, checkpoint, and terminal-result rules;
- schema validation and bounds checking;
- provenance relationships;
- test fixture generation and deterministic oracles where exact verification is possible.

A model may help interpret an ambiguous semantic question, but its free-form preference must not become the hidden owner of deterministic system policy.

## Authoritative inputs

A deterministic decision may legitimately depend on changing reality. When it does, the changing input becomes part of the decision record.

Examples include:

- current runnable-task state;
- persisted resource observations;
- policy/configuration versions;
- capability registry revision;
- canonical event/history state;
- explicitly admitted external observations;
- model result when a semantic classification is deliberately part of the contract.

If a measured value materially changes a durable decision, Prometheist must retain enough information to explain which value was used. “The machine was busy at the time” is not sufficient if the exact resource observation decided whether a worker was launched.

## Ordering and identity

Prometheist should prefer authoritative logical ordering over wall-clock inference when both are available.

Examples:

- event/task sequence is authoritative for total ordering inside a persistence namespace;
- deterministic tie breakers complete partial orderings;
- timestamps remain valuable observations/provenance but must not replace a stable sequence when race-free ordering is required;
- identifiers should be application-owned and derived deterministically from canonical inputs when idempotency/replay requires stable identity.

Random UUIDs may still be valid where stable replay identity is not required, but they must not become an accidental source of policy ordering when a deterministic total order is needed.

## Deterministic scheduling epochs

The Attention Fabric is the clearest example of the rule:

```text
authoritative runnable tasks
        +
authoritative resource snapshot
        +
policy versions
        |
        v
deterministic ranking/admission/preemption
        |
        v
atomic committed epoch + assignments + reservations
        |
        v
workers may execute only committed authority
```

Workers do not race to “grab the next task.” A worker race may affect which CPU core executes code first, but not which durable assignment exists.

## Capability determinism

Model-selected capability indices represent requirements, not an execution schedule.

Prometheist resolves them through application-owned metadata:

```text
bounded model selection
    -> canonical capability IDs
    -> dependency closure
    -> reject missing dependency/cycle
    -> deterministic ready-item ordering
    -> persist/execute
```

The model does not write executor names, dependencies, durable IDs, or execution order.

## Memory determinism

Memory retrieval may include model-assisted semantic mechanisms in future versions, but canonical evidence identity and provenance remain system-owned. The deterministic baseline should be used wherever it can satisfy the information need.

A retrieval result should make clear which parts were produced by:

- exact/structured filtering;
- deterministic lexical/indexed routing;
- deterministic association traversal;
- model/embedding-assisted candidate generation or reranking;
- evidence-admission policy.

A probabilistic candidate generator may propose evidence. It does not become the authoritative source event.

## Model-output boundary

When a model must participate in system control, the system should constrain the model to the smallest mechanically verifiable semantic output that solves the problem.

Preferred representation:

```text
enum / boolean / bounded integer / application-owned ID or index
    before
verified extractive selection
    before
free-form natural language
```

Validation failure is an explicit failure, not permission to infer what the model “probably meant.”

## No race-based authority

The following patterns are unconstitutional:

- multiple workers independently selecting the next queued task and the database winner becoming policy;
- first-completing model call deciding system priority without an explicit policy that makes completion time an authoritative input;
- first process to acquire an ungoverned lock becoming the semantic owner of a durable decision;
- model-generated textual task/capability names being treated as canonical IDs;
- unordered database results becoming persistent ordering accidentally;
- wall-clock arrival replacing an existing authoritative sequence without an explicit design decision.

Concurrency is allowed. Race-based authority is not.

## Replay and reconstruction

A durable decision should be reconstructible from:

1. canonical durable state at the decision boundary;
2. referenced authoritative observations;
3. exact policy/configuration versions;
4. any deliberately admitted model/semantic result;
5. the deterministic algorithm version.

Replay need not reproduce incidental process timing. It must reproduce the durable decision.

## Policy changes

Deterministic behavior is versioned behavior. If a policy changes, Prometheist should preserve enough version/provenance information to explain why the same underlying evidence produced a different decision under a later policy.

A policy migration must not rewrite historical decisions as if the newer policy had always been active.

## Testing requirements

Constitutional determinism should be tested through:

- repeated identical-input runs;
- restart/reconstruction equivalence;
- alternate insertion/worker timing that must yield the same durable outcome;
- deterministic total-order tests for ties;
- stale-policy/snapshot rejection;
- transaction rollback tests proving partial authority is not exposed;
- process-destruction tests proving decisions survive loss of process-local state;
- explicit assertions that unordered/racing worker behavior cannot choose durable authority.

## Relationship to probabilistic intelligence

This rule does not require Prometheist to pretend semantic uncertainty is deterministic. A model may produce different interpretations when the architecture intentionally asks it to reason. The constitutional requirement is that the uncertainty is represented as an explicit input/result with provenance and bounded authority.

Prometheist's design target is therefore:

> **Probabilistic cognition inside deterministic governance.**

That separation allows models to remain useful, replaceable, and improvable without making persistent system behavior unknowable.
