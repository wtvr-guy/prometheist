"""Real-Ollama v0.7 continuity acceptance through fresh guarded workers.

Every turn launches a new CLI process; that controller launches every durable
stage in another freshly guarded process. The model therefore receives neither
an inherited transcript nor persistent worker state.

This experiment deliberately does not turn natural language into an exact-string
oracle. Native answers are printed for human review. The automated verdict proves
that canonical MemoryPacket provenance reached the fresh response worker through
its immutable LLM-invocation artifact, so a plausible-looking answer cannot hide
a continuity or evidence-delivery failure.
