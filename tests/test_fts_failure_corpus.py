"""Documented corpus of retrieval cases: which ones current (structured
filters + Postgres FTS) retrieval can and can't find. This is deliberately a
living document of *failures*, not just successes -- each xfail case is
concrete evidence for when pgvector/embedding-based semantic retrieval
becomes justified (spec: "the first prototype should prove complete event
persistence plus retrieval works before adding sophisticated memory
interpretation").

Run with: uv run pytest tests/test_fts_failure_corpus.py -v
