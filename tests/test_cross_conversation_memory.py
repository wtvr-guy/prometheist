"""Acceptance test for system memory across fresh processes and sessions.

Process A (Conversation A) is told an arbitrary fact and exits completely.
Process B (a brand-new Conversation B) asks about it and must still find it
-- conversation boundaries are organizational metadata, not memory walls.

Requires a running local Ollama with the configured model pulled, and
Postgres reachable via DATABASE_URL. Skipped automatically if Ollama isn't
reachable.
